# ETL Pipeline Configuration
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This configuration drives both the Master Data Seeding (initialization)
# and the Daily ETL Operations (price ingestion).
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ==============================================================================
# 1. Master Data Seeding (Static & Special Assets)
# ==============================================================================
# Assets listed here will be seeded into the database but are NOT actively
# fetched for OHLCV price data by default. They are primarily for:
# - Sentiment Analysis (News/Social)
# - Macroeconomic Indicators
# - Benchmarking (Indices)
# ==============================================================================
seeds:
  # Market Indices & Benchmarks
  # Note: Yahoo Finance tickers often require suffixes (e.g., .BK for Thailand)

# 2. Active Trading Assets (Price Ingestion)
# ==============================================================================
# Assets listed here serve a dual purpose:
# 1. They are auto-seeded into Master Data if not present.
# 2. They are actively targeted by 'run_crypto_etl.py' and 'run_stock_etl.py'.
